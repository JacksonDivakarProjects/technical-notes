## **Predicate Pushdown vs Predicate Pruning**

|Aspect|**Predicate Pushdown**|**Predicate Pruning (Data/File/Partition Pruning)**|
|---|---|---|
|**What it does**|Filters **rows inside each file** at the data source level.|Skips **entire files or partitions** that cannot contain matching rows.|
|**Level of operation**|Row-level|File-level / Partition-level|
|**Requirement on data order**|❌ Not required|✅ Ordering or partitioning helps effectiveness|
|**Performance benefit**|Reduces rows read from disk per file|Reduces number of files read, bigger performance gain|
|**How it works**|Uses column statistics in the file (min/max values) to filter rows while reading.|Uses file metadata, partitioning scheme, or Z-ordering to skip files entirely if their value ranges don’t match the predicate.|
|**Supported by**|Parquet, ORC, Delta, JDBC|Delta Lake (with file stats), partitioned tables, Z-order optimized files|

### **How They Work — Step by Step**

#### **1. Predicate Pushdown**

1. You write a query like:
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE year = 2023;
```

2. Spark checks the **file metadata** (min/max per column).
    
3. Within each file, only rows matching `year = 2023` are read.
    
4. All other rows in the file are ignored, **but the file is still scanned**.
    

**Example:**

- File contains rows `year=2022,2023,2024`
    
- Pushdown reads only `2023` rows inside that file.

#### **2. Predicate Pruning**

1. Spark/Delta examines **file-level metadata** (min/max) or **partition values**.
    
2. If the **entire file/partition cannot satisfy the filter**, it is **skipped completely**.
    

**Example:**

- File 1: `year=[2020–2021]` → skipped
    
- File 2: `year=[2023]` → read
    
- File 3: `year=[2022–2024]` → read only relevant rows via pushdown
    

> **Tip:** Pruning is most effective if files are **clustered, partitioned, or Z-ordered**.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Pushdown** → row-level filtering, works on any file.
    
- **Pruning** → file/partition-level filtering, requires ordered/partitioned data for maximum efficiency.
    
- **Together:** minimize both **rows read** and **files scanned** → maximum query performance.
