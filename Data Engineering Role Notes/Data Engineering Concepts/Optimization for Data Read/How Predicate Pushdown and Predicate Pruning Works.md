Got it, Jack — let’s go **step by step**, so you can see **how predicate pushdown and pruning actually happen internally** in Spark/Delta Lake. I’ll keep it precise and practical.

## **1️⃣ Predicate Pushdown (Row-Level Filtering)**

**Goal:** Only read rows that match the filter from each file.

**How it happens:**

1. You issue a query:
    

```sql
SELECT * FROM sales WHERE region = 'EU';
```

2. Spark’s **Catalyst optimizer** inspects the `WHERE` clause.
    
3. It checks if the **data source supports pushdown** (Parquet, Delta, ORC, JDBC).
    
4. If yes, Spark converts the filter into **data source read instructions**.
    
5. Each file is scanned **row by row**, but only rows matching the predicate are loaded into memory.
    

**Internals:**

- Parquet stores **min/max values** for each column in **row groups**.
    
- Spark uses these to skip irrelevant rows inside the file.
    

**Example:**

- Row group 1: `region=[US–US]` → skipped
    
- Row group 2: `region=[EU–EU]` → read
    

> Result: Only rows with `region='EU'` are loaded → less memory & faster query.

## **2️⃣ Predicate Pruning (File/Partition-Level Filtering)**

**Goal:** Avoid reading files or partitions that cannot match the filter.

**How it happens:**

1. Each file or partition has **metadata**:
    
    - Delta Lake: min/max per column + partition values
        
    - Parquet: row group stats
        
2. Spark checks your query filter against this metadata **before scanning the file**.
    
3. If the file **cannot possibly contain matching rows**, it is **skipped entirely** — no I/O happens.
    

**Example:**

- File 1: `year=[2019–2020]` → filter `year=2023` → skipped
    
- File 2: `year=[2023–2023]` → matches → scanned
    
- File 3: `year=[2022–2024]` → matches → scanned, rows filtered inside via pushdown
    

**Optimization tip:**

- Ordering / partitioning / Z-ordering makes pruning very effective because related rows are stored together, so more files can be skipped.

### **3️⃣ Combined Flow (Delta + Spark)**

**Query:**

```sql
SELECT customer_id, amount FROM sales WHERE region='EU' AND year=2023;
```

**Execution:**

1. **Partition/Pruning check:** Skip files whose min/max or partition value **cannot satisfy** `year=2023 OR region='EU'`.
    
2. **Pushdown:** For files that pass pruning, read only **rows matching filter** using file stats.
    
3. **Column pruning:** Only read `customer_id` and `amount` columns from disk.
    
4. **Result:** Minimal I/O, minimal memory, fast query.

✅ **Key Notes:**

- Pushdown → row-level inside files.
    
- Pruning → file/partition-level skip.
    
- Column pruning → reduces **columns** read.
    
- Ordering, Z-ordering, and partitioning amplify pruning efficiency.

If you want, I can **draw a simple diagram showing files, rows, and which ones are skipped by pushdown vs pruning** — it makes this concept click immediately. Do you want me to do that?
