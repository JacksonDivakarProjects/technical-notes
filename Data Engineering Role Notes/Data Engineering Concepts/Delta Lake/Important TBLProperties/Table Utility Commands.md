### 2. SHOW Commands

**Show Tables:**
```sql
-- Show all tables
SHOW TABLES;

-- Show tables in specific database
SHOW TABLES IN sales_db;

-- Filter tables with pattern
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'event%';

-- Show tables with extended info
SHOW TABLES FROM default;
```

**Show Columns:**
```sql
-- Show table columns
SHOW COLUMNS IN events;

-- Show columns with extended info
SHOW COLUMNS IN events FROM sales_db;
```

**Show Partitions:**

```

### 3. HISTORY - Table Version History

**Describe History:**
```sql
-- Show full operation history
DESCRIBE HISTORY events;

-- Limit history entries
DESCRIBE HISTORY events LIMIT 10;

-- Filter by operation type
DESCRIBE HISTORY events 
WHERE operation IN ('UPDATE', 'DELETE', 'MERGE');

-- Show specific version details
DESCRIBE HISTORY events VERSION AS OF 5;
```

**Example History Output:**
```
+-------+---------------------+---------+-----------+--------------------+----------------+
| version| timestamp          | userId  | operation | operationParameters | notebookId     |
+-------+---------------------+---------+-----------+--------------------+----------------+
| 5     | 2024-01-15 10:30:00| user123 | MERGE     | {predicate: ...}   | notebook-123   |
| 4     | 2024-01-14 09:15:00| user456 | OPTIMIZE  | {zOrderBy: ...}    | notebook-456   |
| 3     | 2024-01-13 14:20:00| user789 | DELETE    | {predicate: ...}   | notebook-789   |
| 2     | 2024-01-12 11:45:00| user123 | UPDATE    | {predicate: ...}   | notebook-123   |
| 1     | 2024-01-11 08:30:00| user456 | CREATE    | {isManaged: false} | notebook-456   |
+-------+---------------------+---------+-----------+--------------------+----------------+
```

**History Analysis Queries:**
```sql
-- Find recent modifications
SELECT 
  version,
  timestamp,
  operation,
  operationParameters
FROM (DESCRIBE HISTORY events)
WHERE timestamp > current_date() - INTERVAL 7 days
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Count operations by type
SELECT 
  operation,
  COUNT(*) as operation_count
FROM (DESCRIBE HISTORY events)
GROUP BY operation
ORDER BY operation_count DESC;
```

### 4. TIMESTAMP - Time Travel Operations

**Time Travel Queries:**
```sql
-- Query by specific timestamp
SELECT * FROM events TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-15 10:00:00';

-- Query by relative time
SELECT * FROM events TIMESTAMP AS OF date_sub(current_date(), 7);

-- Query using version and timestamp together
SELECT * FROM events 
TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-15' 
VERSION AS OF 5;

-- Complex time travel with subqueries
SELECT * FROM events 
TIMESTAMP AS OF (
  SELECT max(event_time) - INTERVAL 1 HOUR 
  FROM events 
  WHERE event_date = current_date()
);
```

**Timestamp Format Examples:**
```sql
-- Various timestamp formats
SELECT * FROM events TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-15';
SELECT * FROM events TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-15 14:30:00';
SELECT * FROM events TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-15T14:30:00Z';
SELECT * FROM events TIMESTAMP AS OF cast('2024-01-15 14:30:00' as timestamp);
```

### 5. RESTORE - Table Recovery

**Restore Syntax:**
```sql
RESTORE TABLE table_name TO TIMESTAMP AS OF timestamp_expression
RESTORE TABLE table_name TO VERSION AS OF version
```

**Restore Examples:**
```sql
-- Restore to specific timestamp
RESTORE TABLE events TO TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-15 10:00:00';

-- Restore to specific version
RESTORE TABLE events TO VERSION AS OF 10;

-- Restore after accidental deletion
RESTORE TABLE events TO TIMESTAMP AS OF date_sub(current_timestamp(), 1);

-- Verify restore operation
DESCRIBE HISTORY events 
WHERE operation = 'RESTORE' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

**Restore Scenarios:**
```sql
-- Scenario 1: Accidental data deletion recovery
-- Check when deletion happened
DESCRIBE HISTORY events 
WHERE operation = 'DELETE' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Restore to before deletion
RESTORE TABLE events TO TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-15 09:00:00';

-- Scenario 2: Schema change rollback
-- Restore to previous schema version
RESTORE TABLE events TO VERSION AS OF 5;

-- Verify schema
DESCRIBE TABLE events;
```

### 6. VACUUM - File Cleanup

**Syntax:**
```sql
VACUUM [TABLE] table_name 
[RETAIN number HOURS] 
[DRY RUN]
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Default vacuum (7 days retention)
VACUUM events;

-- Custom retention period
VACUUM events RETAIN 24 HOURS;

-- Dry run to see what would be deleted
VACUUM events RETAIN 168 HOURS DRY RUN;

-- Force vacuum (careful - can break time travel)
VACUUM events RETAIN 0 HOURS;

-- Vacuum with fully qualified table name
VACUUM sales_db.events RETAIN 48 HOURS;
```

**Vacuum Monitoring:**
```sql
-- Check vacuum results in history
DESCRIBE HISTORY events 
WHERE operation = 'VACUUM' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Compare file counts before and after vacuum
SELECT 
  (SELECT count(*) FROM delta.`s3://bucket/events#files`) as current_files,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM delta.`s3://bucket/events#files@v5`) as previous_files;
```

**Vacuum Safety Checks:**
```sql
-- Always dry run first
VACUUM events RETAIN 24 HOURS DRY RUN;

-- Check current retention settings
SHOW TBLPROPERTIES events ('delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration');

-- Verify time travel range
SELECT 
  min(timestamp) as earliest_time,
  max(timestamp) as latest_time
FROM (DESCRIBE HISTORY events);
```

### 7. CLONING - Table Copy Operations

**Clone Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE clone_name [SHALLOW | DEEP] CLONE source_table
[LOCATION 'path']
[VERSION AS OF version]
[TIMESTAMP AS OF timestamp_expression]
```

**Clone Examples:**
```sql
-- Shallow clone (metadata only)
CREATE TABLE events_staging SHALLOW CLONE events;

-- Deep clone (data + metadata)
CREATE TABLE events_backup DEEP CLONE events
LOCATION 's3://backup/events';

-- Clone specific version
CREATE TABLE events_v5 DEEP CLONE events
VERSION AS OF 5;

-- Clone with timestamp
CREATE TABLE events_snapshot DEEP CLONE events
TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-15 10:00:00';

-- Clone to different location
CREATE TABLE events_dev DEEP CLONE events
LOCATION 's3://dev-bucket/events';
```

**Clone Management:**
```sql
-- Check clone properties
DESCRIBE DETAIL events_staging;
DESCRIBE EXTENDED events_backup;

-- Verify clone source
SHOW TBLPROPERTIES events_staging ('delta.clone.source');
SHOW TBLPROPERTIES events_staging ('delta.clone.sourceVersion');

-- Compare clone with source
SELECT 
  'source' as type,
  count(*) as file_count,
  sum(size) as total_size
FROM delta.`s3://bucket/events#files`
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'shallow_clone' as type,
  count(*) as file_count,
  sum(size) as total_size
FROM delta.`s3://backup/events#files`;
```

**Clone Use Cases:**
```sql
-- Use case 1: Development/testing
CREATE TABLE events_dev SHALLOW CLONE events;
-- Safe experimentation on clone

-- Use case 2: Backup before major changes
CREATE TABLE events_pre_update DEEP CLONE events
LOCATION 's3://backup/events_pre_update';

-- Use case 3: Historical analysis
CREATE TABLE events_jan_snapshot DEEP CLONE events
TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-01-31 23:59:59';
```

## Table Maintenance Commands

### 8. OPTIMIZE - File Compaction

**Syntax:**
```sql
OPTIMIZE table_name
[WHERE predicate]
[ZORDER BY (column1, column2, ...)]
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Full table optimization
OPTIMIZE events;

-- Partition-wise optimization
OPTIMIZE events WHERE partition_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- With Z-ordering for better performance
OPTIMIZE events 
ZORDER BY (user_id, event_time);

-- Combined partition filter and Z-ordering
OPTIMIZE events 
WHERE partition_date = '2024-01-15'
ZORDER BY (event_type, user_id);
```

**Monitor Optimization:**
```sql
-- Check optimization metrics
DESCRIBE HISTORY events 
WHERE operation = 'OPTIMIZE' 
LIMIT 5;

-- View file statistics
SELECT 
  partition_date,
  count(*) as file_count,
  sum(size_bytes) as total_size
FROM delta.`s3://bucket/events#files`
GROUP BY partition_date;
```

### 9. ANALYZE - Statistics Collection

**Syntax:**
```sql
ANALYZE TABLE table_name COMPUTE STATISTICS [FOR COLUMNS col1, col2, ...]
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Compute basic table statistics
ANALYZE TABLE events COMPUTE STATISTICS;

-- Compute column statistics for query optimization
ANALYZE TABLE events COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR COLUMNS user_id, event_type;

-- Compute statistics for specific partitions
ANALYZE TABLE events PARTITION (partition_date='2024-01-01') 
COMPUTE STATISTICS FOR COLUMNS user_id;
```

**View Statistics:**
```sql
-- Show table statistics
DESCRIBE EXTENDED events;

-- Query statistics directly
SELECT * FROM delta.`s3://bucket/events#stats`;
```

## Data Quality & Validation Commands

### 10. Data Validation Utilities

**Check Data Files:**
```sql
-- List all data files
SELECT * FROM delta.`s3://bucket/events#files`;

-- Check file statistics
SELECT 
  path,
  size,
  modificationTime,
  partitionValues
FROM delta.`s3://bucket/events#files`
WHERE size > 1000000;  -- Files larger than 1MB
```

**Validate Data Integrity:**
```python
# Python example for data validation
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

def validate_table_integrity(table_path):
    delta_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, table_path)
    
    # Check for corrupted files
    files = spark.sql(f"""
        SELECT * FROM delta.`{table_path}#files`
    """)
    
    print(f"Total files: {files.count()}")
    print(f"Total size: {files.agg({'size': 'sum'}).collect()[0][0]} bytes")
    
    # Verify we can read the data
    data = spark.read.format("delta").load(table_path)
    print(f"Record count: {data.count()}")
    
    return files.count() > 0 and data.count() > 0
```

## Performance & Monitoring Commands

### 11. Performance Analysis

**Check Table Metrics:**
```sql
-- Get table size and file information
DESCRIBE DETAIL events;

-- Check partition statistics
SELECT 
  partition_date,
  count(*) as file_count,
  avg(size) as avg_file_size,
  sum(size) as total_size
FROM delta.`s3://bucket/events#files`
GROUP BY partition_date
ORDER BY partition_date;
```

## Utility Procedures

### 12. System Procedures

**Generate DDL:**
```sql
-- Get table creation DDL (in Databricks)
SHOW CREATE TABLE events;

-- Alternative approach
CALL delta.get_ddl('default.events');
```
