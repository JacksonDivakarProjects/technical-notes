Excellent doubt 👌 — you caught one of the trickiest parts of **Shuffle Hash Join (SHJ)**. Let’s walk through it step by step.

---

## 🔹 1. What happens before the join

- Both tables are **shuffled** across executors **by join key**.
    
- This guarantees that **all rows with the same key end up in the same partition**.
    
- Now, inside each partition, Spark can safely apply a **hash join**.

## 🔹 2. How duplicates are handled

Let’s say:

**Table A**

```
id | value
1  | A1
1  | A2
```

**Table B**

```
id | value
1  | B1
1  | B2
```

Steps during SHJ:

1. Spark picks the **smaller side** in each partition to build a **hash table** keyed by `id`.  
    Example hash table (from Table A):
    
    ```
    key=1 → [A1, A2]
    ```
    
2. Then Spark **probes** this hash table with rows from the other side (Table B).
    
    - For B1 → finds key=1 → returns (A1,B1), (A2,B1)
        
    - For B2 → finds key=1 → returns (A1,B2), (A2,B2)
        
3. Result = **Cartesian product for that key**
    
    ```
    (1, A1, B1)
    (1, A2, B1)
    (1, A1, B2)
    (1, A2, B2)
    ```
    

So yes — **duplicates are not a problem** because the hash table stores **a list of values per key**.

## 🔹 3. Why Shuffle Hash Join is chosen

- Faster than Sort-Merge if data is not too large.
    
- No need to sort; just shuffle and hash.
    
- But memory is the bottleneck → if one partition’s hash table gets too big, Spark may spill to disk or fall back to Sort-Merge Join.

## 🔹 4. Key Notes

- **All duplicates for a key end up in the same partition after shuffle.**
    
- **Hash table stores a list of values for each key.**
    
- **Join output = cross-product for duplicate keys.**
    
- **If keys are skewed (e.g., one key has millions of rows), performance degrades.**
    

---

👉 So in short:  
The **shuffle step handles grouping by key**, and the **hash join logic expands duplicates by storing multiple values per key** and doing cross-product.

Do you want me to also **draw a mini diagram (ASCII-style)** of how the shuffle → hash table → probe happens with duplicates? That makes it 100% crystal clear.
