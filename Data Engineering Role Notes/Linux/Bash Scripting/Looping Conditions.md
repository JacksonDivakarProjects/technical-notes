## 1. What Are Loops? 🤔

**Loops** let you repeat a set of commands multiple times. Instead of writing the same code over and over, you write it once and tell Bash to repeat it.

Think of it like this: Instead of telling someone "Take one step" 100 times, you say "Take steps until you reach the end."

### Why Use Loops?
- **Automate repetitive tasks**
- **Process multiple files**
- **Handle lists of items**
- **Create counters**
- **Wait for conditions to be met**

---

## 2. The For Loop 🔄

The `for` loop is perfect when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something, or when you're working with a list of items.

### Basic Syntax:
```bash
for variable in list_of_items
do
    # Commands to execute
    echo "Processing: $variable"
done
```

### Example 1: Simple List
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is called a shebang - it tells the system this is a Bash script

for fruit in apple banana orange
do
    echo "I like $fruit"
done
```

**Output:**
```
I like apple
I like banana
I like orange
```

### Example 2: Using a Range
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for number in {1..5}
do
    echo "Count: $number"
done
```

### Example 3: Processing Files
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in *.txt
do
    echo "Found text file: $file"
done
```

### Example 4: C-Style For Loop
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for (( i=1; i<=5; i++ ))
do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

---

## 3. The While Loop ⏳

The `while` loop keeps running **as long as a condition is true**. It's great when you don't know exactly how many times you need to loop.

### Basic Syntax:
```bash
while [ condition ]
do
    # Commands to execute
    echo "Looping..."
done
```

### Example 1: Simple Counter
```bash
#!/bin/bash
counter=1

while [ $counter -le 5 ]
do
    echo "Counter: $counter"
    ((counter++))  # Increment the counter
done
```

### Example 2: Reading User Input
```bash
#!/bin/bash
answer=""

while [ "$answer" != "yes" ]
do
    echo "Do you want to continue? (yes/no)"
    read answer
done
echo "Finally!"
```

### Example 3: Reading a File Line by Line
```bash
#!/bin/bash
while read line
do
    echo "Line: $line"
done < file.txt
```

---

## 4. The Until Loop 🔄

The `until` loop is the opposite of `while` - it runs **until a condition becomes true**.

### Basic Syntax:
```bash
until [ condition ]
do
    # Commands to execute
    echo "Waiting..."
done
```

### Example: Waiting for a File to Exist
```bash
#!/bin/bash
until [ -f /tmp/myfile.txt ]
do
    echo "File doesn't exist yet. Waiting..."
    sleep 2
done
echo "File found!"
```

---

## 5. Loop Control 🎮

Sometimes you need to change how a loop behaves. Bash provides special commands for this:

### `break` - Exit the Loop Early
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for number in {1..10}
do
    if [ $number -eq 5 ]
    then
        echo "Breaking at 5!"
        break
    fi
    echo "Number: $number"
done
```

### `continue` - Skip to Next Iteration
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for number in {1..5}
do
    if [ $number -eq 3 ]
    then
        echo "Skipping 3!"
        continue
    fi
    echo "Number: $number"
done
```

### `exit` - Exit the Entire Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for number in {1..5}
do
    if [ $number -eq 3 ]
    then
        echo "Exiting script!"
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "Number: $number"
done
```

## 6. Nested Loops 🔄🔄

You can put loops inside other loops! This is useful for working with grids or multiple dimensions.

### Example: Multiplication Table
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Simple Multiplication Table:"
echo "---------------------------"

for i in {1..3}
do
    for j in {1..3}
    do
        result=$((i * j))
        echo -n "$i x $j = $result   "
    done
    echo ""  # New line after each row
done
```

**Output:**
```
Simple Multiplication Table:
---------------------------
1 x 1 = 1   1 x 2 = 2   1 x 3 = 3   
2 x 1 = 2   2 x 2 = 4   2 x 3 = 6   
3 x 1 = 3   3 x 2 = 6   3 x 3 = 9   
```

## 7. Practical Examples 🛠️

Let's look at some real-world scenarios:

### Example 1: Backup Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup important files
backup_dir="/backup"
files_to_backup="/home/user/documents/*.pdf"

for file in $files_to_backup
do
    if [ -f "$file" ]
    then
        cp "$file" "$backup_dir"
        echo "Backed up: $(basename $file)"
    fi
done
```

### Example 2: System Monitoring
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check disk usage every minute until it's too high
threshold=80

while true
do
    usage=$(df / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
    
    if [ $usage -gt $threshold ]
    then
        echo "WARNING: Disk usage is $usage%"
        echo "Sending alert..."
        # Add your alert command here
        break
    fi
    
    echo "Disk usage: $usage% - OK"
    sleep 60
done
```

### Example 3: User Management
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create multiple user accounts
usernames="alice bob charlie diana"

for user in $usernames
do
    echo "Creating account for $user"
    # In real script: sudo useradd $user
    # For now, just simulate:
    echo "Account $user created successfully!"
done
```

### Example 4: File Organizer
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Organize files by extension
for file in *
do
    if [ -f "$file" ]
    then
        extension="${file##*.}"
        mkdir -p "$extension" 2>/dev/null
        mv "$file" "$extension/"
        echo "Moved $file to $extension/"
    fi
done
```

## 8. Best Practices & Tips 💡

### 1. **Always Quote Variables**
```bash
# Good:
for file in "$file_list"
do
    echo "Processing: $file"
done

# Bad (breaks with spaces in filenames):
for file in $file_list
do
    echo "Processing: $file"
done
```

### 2. **Use Meaningful Variable Names**
```bash
# Good:
for student_name in $student_list

# Confusing:
for x in $y
```

### 3. **Add Comments**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script processes log files
# Created by: Your Name
# Date: 2024

for logfile in /var/log/*.log
do
    # Check if file exists and is readable
    if [ -r "$logfile" ]
    then
        echo "Processing: $logfile"
        # Add processing commands here
    fi
done
```

### 4. **Test with `set -x` for Debugging**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x  # Shows each command before executing

for i in {1..3}
do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done

set +x  # Turns off debugging
```

### 5. **Handle Errors**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit on any error

for file in /important/files/*
do
    if [ ! -f "$file" ]
    then
        echo "Error: $file not found!" >&2
        continue  # Skip to next file instead of exiting
    fi
    # Process the file
done
```

### 6. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- **Infinite loops**: Always have an exit condition!
- **Unquoted variables**: Causes problems with spaces
- **Forgetting to increment counters** in while loops
- **Using `ls` in loops**: Use globbing (`*.txt`) instead

## 🎯 Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

| Loop Type | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `for` | Known iterations, list processing | `for file in *.txt` |
| `while` | Unknown iterations, conditions | `while [ $x -lt 10 ]` |
| `until` | Wait for condition | `until [ -f file.txt ]` |
| `break` | Exit loop early | `break` |
| `continue` | Skip iteration | `continue` |

## 🚀 Practice Exercises

Try these to test your understanding:

1. **Countdown Timer**: Write a script that counts from 10 to 1
2. **File Counter**: Count how many `.txt` files are in a directory
3. **Number Guesser**: Create a simple number guessing game
4. **Directory Creator**: Create directories named `week01` through `week52`

---

## 📖 Next Steps

Now that you understand loops, you can:
1. Combine loops with **conditionals** (`if`, `case`)
2. Use loops with **functions** to create reusable code
3. Explore **arrays** for more complex data handling
4. Learn about **command substitution** to use command output in loops

Remember: Practice makes perfect! Start with simple loops and gradually build up to more complex scripts. Happy scripting! 🐚✨

**Pro Tip**: You can run these examples directly in your terminal by:
1. Creating a file: `nano myscript.sh`
2. Adding the code
3. Making it executable: `chmod +x myscript.sh`
4. Running it: `./myscript.sh`

Or test small loops directly in the terminal:
```bash
for i in {1..3}; do echo "Test $i"; done
```
