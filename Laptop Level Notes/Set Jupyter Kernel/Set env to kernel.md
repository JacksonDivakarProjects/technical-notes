You want to make Jupyter Notebook use a specific Python environment (like a virtualenv or conda environment). Here’s the clean, step-by-step way to do it:

---

### **Step 1: Activate your environment**

If you’re using **virtualenv**:

```bash
source /path/to/your/env/bin/activate
```

If you’re using **conda**:

```bash
conda activate my_env
```

---

### **Step 2: Install `ipykernel` in that environment**

```bash
pip install ipykernel
```

---

### **Step 3: Add the environment to Jupyter**

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=my_env --display-name "Python (my_env)"
```

- `--name` is the internal name Jupyter uses.
    
- `--display-name` is what shows up in the notebook interface.
    

---

### **Step 4: Select the environment in Jupyter**

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open a notebook, then go to:
    

```
Kernel -> Change Kernel -> Python (my_env)
```

Now your notebook runs in that environment.

If you want, I can also show a **shortcut to switch environments without reinstalling kernels every time**—it’s faster for frequent environment switching. Do you want me to show that?
