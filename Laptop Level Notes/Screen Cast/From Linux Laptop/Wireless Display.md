Understood. I’ll give you a **complete, future-proof guide** for **GNOME Network Displays (Wireless Display / Miracast Receiver)** covering **all installation methods** and **exact troubleshooting steps** — **no fluff, no missing pieces**.

This lets your **Linux laptop receive screen-cast from Windows, Android, Smart TVs, etc.**

---

# 🎯 **Goal**

Enable **Linux Laptop to act as a _Wireless Display Receiver_**.

You will be able to:

- Cast **from Windows (Win+K)**
    
- Cast **from Android (Smart View / Cast)**
    
- Cast **from another Linux system**
    

Using:  
**GNOME Network Displays**

---

# ✅ **Check Hardware Compatibility First**

Miracast requires **Wi-Fi Direct support**.

Run:

```bash
iw list | grep -A10 "Supported interface modes"
```

Look for **these two**:

```
P2P-device
P2P-GO
```

|If You See|Result|
|---|---|
|✅ `P2P` modes present|Miracast **will work**|
|❌ P2P missing|**Miracast cannot work** (use Deskreen / VNC instead)|

If missing → tell me your **WiFi card model**:

```bash
lspci | grep -i wireless
```

I’ll guide alternatives.

# ⚠️ Common Fixes

### 1) If device does not appear:

Enable Wi-Fi P2P:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

### 2) If video plays but no audio:

Install PipeWire + WirePlumber:

```bash
sudo apt install pipewire wireplumber pipewire-audio-client-libraries -y
```

Restart:

```bash
systemctl --user restart wireplumber pipewire
```

### 3) If display connects but is black:

Enable **Hardware Acceleration**:

```bash
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-vaapi
```

---

# 💡 **If Your Hardware Does NOT Support Miracast**

Use **Deskreen** (browser-based wireless display):

```bash
npx deskreen
```

No app needed on phone/TV — just open link in browser.

---

# ✅ **Now You Have:**

✔ Every install method  
✔ Compatibility test  
✔ Usage instructions  
✔ Audio fix  
✔ Black screen fix
