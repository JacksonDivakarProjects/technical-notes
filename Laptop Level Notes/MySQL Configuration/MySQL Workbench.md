Ah — the issue is twofold:

1. **The MySQL APT repo public key is missing**, so `apt` won’t fetch packages from it.
    
2. On Zorin OS (Ubuntu-based), `mysql-workbench-community` isn’t directly available via `apt` after that error.
    

The cleanest solution now is to **use Snap**, which works reliably on Zorin/Ubuntu.

---

### **1. Install Snap if not installed**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd -y
```

---

### **2. Install MySQL Workbench via Snap**

```bash
sudo snap install mysql-workbench-community
```

- Snap automatically handles dependencies and keys. ✅
    

---

### **3. Launch Workbench**

```bash
mysql-workbench-community
```

Or find it in your applications menu.

> Note: Snap packages run in a confined environment, so it may take a few seconds longer to start the first time.

---

### **Optional:** Fix APT repo key (if you still want the `apt` route)

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys B7B3B788A8D3785C
sudo apt update
```

Then `sudo apt install mysql-workbench-community` might work, but Snap is simpler on Zorin.

---

If you want, I can give a **one-shot command sequence that installs MySQL server + Workbench on Zorin OS using Snap** so it works perfectly without APT key errors. Do you want me to do that?
